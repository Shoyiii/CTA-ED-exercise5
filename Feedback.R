# Feedback: CTA exercise 5 (2024)

# question 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# very good 

# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# excellent. Good interpretation as well. Would have been good to explain why you picked 15 topics?

# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# you ran the code correctly but didn't interpret output. It would have been worth looking for Pretex documentation
# to figure out what to learn from the output and what to do accordingly
# you couldn't knit the doc because your Pretext library wasn't properly installed/loaded

# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# excellent. You could comment a bit more. 
# main problem was that you didn't produce a knitted html output
# to avoid this, make sure to knit once you're done with your code, 
# make sure all relevant libraries are included and loaded in your code
# and finally, make sure that no important code chunk is specified as 'eval=FALSE', 
# which tells R not to execute that code chunk

# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# very good work, except for question 3, where you didn't interpret the output.
# overall, very good
